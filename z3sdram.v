/* Hardware Bus Error/Interrupt (/BERR)
This is a general indicator of a bus fault or special condition of some kind. Any
expansion card capable of detecting a hardware error relating directly to that card can assert
/BERR when that bus error condition is detected, especially any sort of harmful hardware error
condition. This signal is the strongest possible indicator of a bad situation, as it causes all PICs
to get off the bus, and will usually generate a level 2 exception on the host CPU. For any
condition that can be handled in software and doesn’t pose an immediate threat to hardware,
notification via a standard processor interrupt is the better choice. The bus controller will drive
/BERR in the event of a detected bus collision or DMA error (an attempt by a bus master to
access local bus resources it doesn’t have valid access permission for). All cards must monitor
/BERR and be prepared to tri-state all of their on-bus output buffers whenever this signal is
asserted. An expansion bus master will attempt to retry a cycle aborted by a single /BERR and
notify system software in the case of two subsequent /BERR results. Since any number of
devices may assert /BERR, and all bus cards must monitor it, any device that drives /BERR
must drive with an open collector or similar device, and any device that monitors /BERR should
place a minimal load on it. This signal is pulled high by a passive backplane resistor.
Note that, especially for the slave device being addressed, that /BERR alone is not always
necessaily an indication of a bus failure in the pure sense, but may indicate some other kind of
unusual condition. Therefore, a device should still respond to the bus address, if otherwise
appropriate, when a /BERR condition is indicated. It simply tri-states is bus buffers and other
outputs, and waits for a change in the bus state. If the /BERR signal is negated with the cycle
unterminated, the special condition has been resolved and the slave responds to the rest of the
cycle as it normally would have. If the cycle is terminated by the bus master, the resolution of
the special condition has indicated that the addressed slave is not needed, and so the cycle
terminates without the slave being used. */

/* System Reset (/RESET, /IORST)
The bus supplies two versions of the system reset signal. The /RESET signal is
bidirectional and unbuffered, allowing an expansion card to hard reset the system. It should only
be used by boards that need this reset capability, and is driven only by an open collector or
similar device. The /IORST signal is a buffered output-only version of the reset signal that
should be used as the normal reset input to boards not concerned with resetting the system on
their own. All expansion devices are required to reset their autoconfiguration logic when
/IORST is asserted. These signals are pulled high by passive backplane resistors. */

/* Backplane Type Sense (SenseZ3)
This line can be used by the PIC to determine the backplane type. It is grounded on a
Zorro II backplane, but floating on a Zorro III backplane. The Zorro III PIC connects this signal
to a 1K pullup resistor to generate a real logic level for this line. It’s possible, though more
complicated, to build a Zorro III PIC that can actually run in Zorro II mode when in a Zorro II
backplane. It’s hardly necessary or required to support this backward compatibility mechanism,
and in many cases it’ll be inpractical. The Zorro III specification does require that this signal be
used, at least, to shut the card down and pass /CFGIN to /CFGOUT when in a Zorro II
backplane. */

input			SENSEZ3;		// Z3 sense


/* Configuration Chain (/CFGINN, /CFGOUTN)
The slot configuration mechanism uses the bus signals /CFGOUTN and /CFGINN, where
"N" refers to the slot number. Each slot has its own version of both signals, which make up the
configuration chain between slots. Each subsequent /CFGINN is a result of all previous
/CFGOUTs, going from slot 0 to the last slot on the expansion bus. During the autoconfiguration
process, an unconfigured Zorro III PIC responds to the 64K address space starting at either
$00E80000 or $FF000000 if its /CFGINN signal is asserted. All unconfigured PICs start up with
/CFGOUTN negated. When configured, or told to "shut up", a PIC will assert its /CFGOUTN,
which results in the /CFGINN of the next slot being asserted. Backplane logic automatically
passes on the state of the previous /CFGOUTN to the next /CFGINN for any slot not occupied by
a PIC, so there’s no need to sequentially populate the expansion bus slots. */

/* Slave (/SLAVEN)								
Each slot has its own /SLAVEN output, driven actively, all of which go into the collision
detect circuitry. The "N" refers to the expansion slot number of the particular /SLAVE signal.
Whenever a Zorro III PIC is responding to an address on the bus, it must assert its /SLAVEN
output very quickly. If more than one /SLAVEN output occurs for the same address, or if a PIC
asserts its /SLAVEN output for an address reserved by the local bus, a collision is registered and
the bus controller asserts /BERR. The bus controller will assert /SLAVEN back to the
interrupting device selected during a Quick Interrupt cycle, so any device supporting Quick
Interrupts must be capable of tri-stating its /SLAVEN; all others can drive SLAVEN with a
normal active output. */

/*
A Zorro III cycle begins when the bus master simultaneously drives addressing information on
the address bus and memory space codes on the FCN lines, quickly following that with the
assertion of the Full Cycle Strobe, /FCS; this is called the address phase of the bus. Any active
slaves will latch the bus address on the falling edge of /FCS, and the bus master will tri-state the
addressing information very shortly after /FCS is asserted. It’s necessary only to latch A31-A8;
the low order A7-A2 addresses and FCN codes are non-multiplexed.

As quickly as possible after /FCS is asserted, a slave device will respond to the bus address by
asserting its /SLAVEN line, and possibly other special-purpose signals. The autoconfiguration
process assigns a unique address range to each PIC base on its needs, just as on the Zorro II bus.
Only one slave may respond to any given bus address; the bus controller will generate a /BERR
signal if more than one slave responds to an address, or if a single slave responds to an address
reserved for the local bus (this is called a bus collision, and should never happen in normal
operation). Slaves don’t usually respond to CPU memory space or other reserved memory space
types, as indicated by the memory space code on the FCN lines (see Chapter 4 for details)!

The data phase is the next part of the cycle, and it’s started when the bus master asserts DOE
onto the bus, indicating that data operations can be started. The strobes are the same for both
read and write cycles, but of course the data transfer direction is different.

For a read cycle, the bus master drives at least one of the data strobes /DSN, indicating the
physical transfer size requested (however, cachable slaves must always supply all 32 bits of
data). The slave responds by driving data onto the bus, and then asserting /DTACK. The bus
master then terminates the cycle by negating /FCS, at which point the slave will negate its
/SLAVEN line and tri-state its data. The cycle is done at this point. There are a few actions that
modify a cycle termination, those will be covered in later sections.

The write cycle starts out the same way, up until DOE is asserted. At this point, it’s the master
that must drive data onto the bus, and then assert at least one /DSN line to indicate to the slave
that data is valid and which data bytes are being written. The slave has the data for its use until it
terminates the cycle by asserting /DTACK, at which point the master can negate /FCS and
tri-state its data at any point. For maximum bus bandwidth, the slave can latch data on the
falling edge of the logically ORed data strobes; the bus master doesn’t sample /DTACK until
after the data strobes are asserted, so a slave can actually assert /DTACK any time after /FCS.
